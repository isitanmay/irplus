### Why IR+ ? ###


Institutional repositories were created as a way for organizations to provide users with a method for self-service preservation and dissemination of digital information. However, many organizations have reported difficulty convincing users to voluntarily deposit material into their repositories. The University of Rochester experienced similar difficulties, and carried out studies of its faculty and graduate students to determine the reasons for their lack of interest in using the repository. Our findings indicated a need for additional features to assist in the scholarly communication process, offering an opportunity to extend the repository and gain participation earlier in the authoring process. Driven by these user needs, the University of Rochester created IR+. While providing core repository functionality, IR+ offers tools for authoring, collaboration, portfolios, and analytics - providing value throughout the authoring and academic lifecycles. These new features form the foundations for Rochester's approach to attracting users into the repository, an effort that is already showing positive results. The University of Rochester sees these features as only the beginning of what could be many ways for the repository to be expanded and leveraged, not only to support the needs of its users but also to help further scholarly communication.
